# Battle-Bean---Nescafe-Starbucks
My recent case study project with Numerator, involved an in-depth analysis of the shopping behaviors, demographics, and preferences of Nescafe and Starbucks consumers. By diving deep into key factors such as lifestyle choices, income brackets, and marketing touchpoints, we developed actionable strategies to help Nescafe attract Starbucks shoppers.
